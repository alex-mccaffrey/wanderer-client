## Summary

Wanderer was developed to bridge the gap between safety and privacy. Location awareness of friends and family can be a great safety tool. But knowing their exact location at all times can sometimes be a breach of privacy. Wanderer allows users to decide when to share their location with others, leaving a trail of breadcrumbs with their whereabouts.
